Real Estate Price Prognostication with Machine Learning Models

Overview

This repository contains the research paper "Real Estate Price Prognostication with Machine Learning Models", presented at SCEECS 2024. The study explores machine learning techniques for accurate real estate price prediction using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVM, coupled with robust data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Key Highlights

Dataset: Features like area type, location, size, and price from Kaggle.

Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), R-Squared (RÂ²).

Outcome: Linear Regression balanced interpretability and accuracy; Random Forest showed high predictive power.
